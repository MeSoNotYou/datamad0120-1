    "Lesson Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "    Learn about iPyWidgets.\n",
    "    Introduce the interact decorator.\n",
    "    Create visualizations with interactive sliders.\n",
    "    Create visualizations with interactive drop-down boxes.\n",
    "    Create visualizations with interactive check boxes.\n",
    "    Create visualizations with interactive text boxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last lesson, we covered how to make interactive, Javascript-based visualizations using Python and the plotly and cufflinks libraries. This provided us with the ability to hover over the plot points in the chart to see the values, and it also enabled us to include and exclude groups from the visualization by simply clicking on them in the legend.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interactivity doesn't have to stop there. In this lesson, we are going learn how to make our visualizations even more interactive via the use of widgets such as sliders, drop-down boxes, check boxes, and text boxes. These widgets are going to control aspects of the information that get passed to our visualizations. Using these widgets to change values is going to cause the visualizations to change themselves. We will be using these widgets to extend the interactivity of charts generated with plotly and cufflinks.\n",
    "\n",
    "To incorporate widgets into our visualizations, we will need to ensure that we have the iPyWidgets library installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ pip install ipywidgets\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's also go ahead and import everything we are going to need for this lesson."

    "# The Interact Decorator\n",
    "\n",
    "IPyWidgets library has a variety of functionality for creating interactive widgets, but the interact decorator is both the easiest way to get started and the most useful, so we will be focusing it for this lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interact decorator accepts a few different types of inputs, and the format of those inputs determines the type of widget that is displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Slider: a numeric value, (min, max), or (min, max, step)\n",
    "    Drop-Down Box: a list or dictionary\n",
    "    Check Box: True or False values\n",
    "    Text Box: a string enclosed in quotes\n",
    "\n",
    "We will see examples of each of these in the sections below, both individually and then all together.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Interactive Sliders\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most useful types of widgets you can use for numeric variables is the slider. Sliders allow you to modify numeric inputs that are fed to your visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see a basic example of this with the histogram below. One of the challenges of working with histograms is determining an appropriate number of bins. Widgets can help us with this by allowing us to quickly and easily view different numbers of bins without having to manually input them into our code and regenerate the visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the interact decorator to create a slider widget where we specify a range of bins (from as few as 8 to as many as there are unique tenures). Then, we can simply define a hist function (it really doesn't matter what you name it) that accepts the dynamic number of bins and plugs them in to a plotly histogram so that the number of bins in the visualization updates as you modify the values with the slider."

To generate one, we can pass a list to our interact decorator consisting of the fields we would like to be able to choose from. We can then define a linechart function that accepts the input we have chosen from the drop-down box, pivots our data set so that the columns represent the categorical values in the field we have chosen, and then generates a plotly line chart with lines showing changes in churn rate for each category.\n",

The way to do this is to map whether the check box is checked to a corresponding condition for the binary field. Once that is done, you'd just need to filter the data set based on those conditions.\n",

Inside our barchart function, we write some conditional statements that will translate those True/False options into conditions that we can use to filter our data. We then apply those filters and group the data by PaymentMethod, calculating the average churn rate for each. Finally, we generate a bar chart that displays the average churn rate for each payment method based on the filters applied via the check boxes."
